
Name of Project : Mask Detection using AI

Files :
1. detect_mask_image.py
2. detect_mask_video.py
3. mask_detector.model
4. examples folder
5. face_detector folder

How to Use?

1. Install the required libraries of Python :

You can install it via pip install command. Suppose you want to install keras library, then you can run this command in Command Prompt/Terminal

pip install keras

Similarly you have to install all libraries that are used in this project.

2. Detect Mask from Image :

To detect whether a person has mask on his face or not, you have to use detect_mask_image.py file

For executing this file you have to type this command in Command Prompt/Terminal

python detect_mask_image.py --image examples/example_01.png

Here example_01.png is the image file which will be used for detecting whether there is mask or not.

When you will run this file : the deep learning model will detect the mask and output image with detected label (Mask or No Mask) will be shown.

3. Detect Mask from Video :

To detect the mask from the video (webcam) you have to use the detect_mask_video.py file

For executing this file you have to type this command in Command Prompt/Terminal

python detect_mask_video.py

This file will initiate the webcam video and it will detect the Mask & No Mask
